abstract: "Android robots capable of emotional interactions with humans have considerable
potential for application to research. While several studies developed androids that can
exhibit human-like emotional facial expressions, few have empirically validated androids’
facial expressions. To investigate this issue, we developed an android head called
Nikola based on human psychology and conducted three studies to test the validity
of its facial expressions. In Study 1, Nikola produced single facial actions, which were
evaluated in accordance with the Facial Action Coding System. The results showed
that 17 action units were appropriately produced. In Study 2, Nikola produced the
prototypical facial expressions for six basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness,
sadness, and surprise), and naïve participants labeled photographs of the expressions.
The recognition accuracy of all emotions was higher than chance level. In Study 3, Nikola
produced dynamic facial expressions for six basic emotions at four different speeds,
and naïve participants evaluated the naturalness of the speed of each expression. The
effect of speed differed across emotions, as in previous studies of human expressions.
These data validate the spatial and temporal patterns of Nikola’s emotional facial
expressions, and suggest that it may be useful for future psychological studies and
real-life applications."
