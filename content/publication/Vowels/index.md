abstract: "Previous studies have reported that verbal sounds are associated—non-arbitrarily—withspecific  meanings  (e.g., sound symbolism  and  onomatopoeia), including  visual  information likefacial expressions; however, it remains unclear how mouth shapes used to utter each vowel createour semantic impressions. We asked 81 Japanese participants to evaluate mouth shapes associatedwith five Japanese vowels by using 10 five-item semantic differential scales. Results revealed thatthe physical characteristics of the facial expressions (mouth shapes) induced specific evaluations.For example, the mouth shape made to voice the vowel “a” was the one with the biggest, widest,and   highest   facial   components   compared   to   other   mouth   shapes,   and   people   perceived   wordscontaining that vowel sound as bigger. The mouth shapes used to pronounce the vowel “i” wereperceived   as   more   likable   than   the   other   four   vowels.   These   findings   indicate   that   the   mouthshapes producing vowels imply specific meanings. Our study provides clues about the meaning ofverbal sounds and what the facial expressions in communication represent to the perceiver."
